** Running

Create a [[https://id.getharvest.com/developers][personal access token]] in your Harvest account.

Add a =config.yml= in either =~/Library/Application Support/harvest/= (macOS) or =~/.config/harvest/= (Linux) with the following format:
  
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  auth:
    access_token: xxx
    account_id: xxx
#+END_SRC
  
Run the app:
  
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cargo run -- timer
#+END_SRC
  
If you don't provide any arguments, you will get a help message listing possible commands.

*** Toggling the Current Timer

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo run -- timer toggle
#+END_SRC

*** Print the Current Timer

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo run -- timer current --continuous
#+END_SRC

=--continuous= optionally makes the app run forever, printing out the current timer information every few seconds, which is useful for redirecting into a status bar.
